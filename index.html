        <h1>How to Play Chess</h1>
        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king.</p>
        
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves one square in any direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves any number of squares in any direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
            <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
            <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
            <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves one square forward (two squares on its first move) and captures diagonally.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Special Moves</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Castling:</strong> A move involving the king and a rook that moves the king two squares towards the rook and the rook to the square over which the king crossed.</li>
            <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can occur immediately after a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and an enemy pawn could have captured it had it moved only one square forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the far end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king), usually a queen.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and there is no legal move to escape the threat.</p>
